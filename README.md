## General Information

Purrfect Blog is a simple, welcoming space where people can sign up, write posts, share thoughts, and browse what others have written. Visitors can read recent entries, open a post to see the full story, make changes if they need to fix something, or remove a post they no longer want visible. Other readers can show support (or disagreement) through a basic voting feature, helping the most appreciated posts rise to the top. If a post is removed, the site lets you know it no longer exists instead of showing an error. The goal is to provide a clean, friendly place to express ideas without extra clutter ‚Äî quick to start using, easy to understand, and focused on writing and discovery.

## üìñ About this Software

Purrfect Blog is a lightweight ASP.NET MVC 5 ( .NET Framework 4.7.2 ) blogging application demonstrating a full CRUD + authentication workflow with voting and per‚Äëauthor ownership rules. It is intentionally minimal, focusing on clarity and best practices over framework abstraction. Core pieces include:
‚Ä¢	Strongly-typed Razor views with Data Annotation validation
‚Ä¢	Post lifecycle: create, read (global + detail), edit, delete (author-only)
‚Ä¢	Voting system with toggle semantics (upvote / downvote / undo / flip)
‚Ä¢	Route customization (/post/{id}, /EditPost/{id})
‚Ä¢	Friendly 404-like experience for deleted posts
‚Ä¢	Dashboard filtered to the signed-in user
‚Ä¢	Basic security: anti-forgery tokens, authorization checks, ownership enforcement
‚Ä¢	Separation of domain models vs. view models for safer binding

This project can serve as:
  1.	A teaching aid for developers new to ASP.NET MVC & EF6.
  2.	A quick-start template for small content or community sites.
  3.	A portfolio artifact showing practical implementation of common web app patterns.
